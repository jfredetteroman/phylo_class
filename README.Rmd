\section{Step 1: Collect Sequences}


\subsection{BLAST Searches}

Using the species list included in this repository and the genome database specified in the list, run a BLAST all species against E. affinis sequence included in this repository. 

\subsection{Convert to Amino Acid Sequences}

Using ExPASy's translate tool (https://web.expasy.org/translate/), convert nucleotide sequences for each species to amino acid sequences.

\subsection{Create FASTA file}

Add each amino acid sequence to a FASTA file. To save time, the resulting FASTA file has been included in this repository.

\section{To-Do List--Remaining Steps}


\subsection{Sequence Alignment}

Install TM-Coffee

\subsection{Tree Estimation}

Install IQ-TREE
